# Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Fraud

**Academic fraud at Harvard - How Peterson invented mythology and called it scholarship**

---

## The Central Fraud

Jordan Peterson's *Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief* (1999) claims to have discovered a "proto-heroic symbol" that exists across human mythology—the hero who explores the unknown. This forms the foundation of his entire theoretical framework and subsequent radicalization methodology.

**The problem: It's fabricated.**

## What Peterson Claims

In *Maps of Meaning*, Peterson argues:

- A universal "heroic symbol" appears across all mythological traditions
- This hero represents the individual who confronts chaos and establishes order
- The Osiris/Horus myth exemplifies this proto-heroic pattern
- The meaning is "intrinsic to the mythological perspective"

He uses this framework to teach:
- Chaos/Order binary (gendered: feminine = chaos, masculine = order)
- The "hero" as symbolic representation in the reader's psyche
- Enemies: feminism (chaos), Marxism (disorder), postmodernism (threat to order)

## The Reality: Fabrication

### 1. The Osiris Problem

**Peterson created a version of Osiris that doesn't exist in Egyptian mythology.**

- Egyptian mythology tells the story of Osiris (god of the afterlife), murdered by Set, resurrected by Isis
- Peterson reinterprets Osiris to fit his invented "hero explores unknown" framework
- **He has no sources for his Osiris claims**
- He forced his invented hero narrative to "make sense" with fabricated Osiris/Horus interpretations

### 2. "Mythological Perspective" = Lying

Peterson claims the meaning is "intrinsic to mythological perspective."

Translation: **"Mythological perspective" means myth-making. Myth-making means lying.**

He's not discovering universal patterns—he's inventing them and presenting fabrications as ancient universal truths.

### 3. The False Dichotomy

The entire Chaos/Order framework is a false dichotomy designed for radicalization:

- Positions "Order" (masculine, Western, traditional) as good
- Positions "Chaos" (feminine, Marxist, postmodern) as threat
- Creates imagined war where readers adopt "hero" role
- Provides psychological framework for hostility toward feminists, leftists, etc.

## The Pattern of Fraud

Peterson's academic fraud follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Fabricate symbolism**: Invent meanings for Osiris, yin-yang, "proto-heroic symbol"
2. **Claim universality**: Present fabrications as ancient cross-cultural truths
3. **Provide no sources**: Zero citations for invented interpretations
4. **Use for radicalization**: Framework creates enemies (feminists, Marxists) and heroes (followers)

## Academic Fraud at Harvard

Peterson developed *Maps of Meaning* during his time at Harvard (1993-1998). This work:

- Was presented as legitimate scholarship
- Had no proper sources for core claims
- Invented mythology and called it research
- Became the basis for his radicalization framework

**This is academic fraud.**

## The Radicalization Connection

This fabricated framework directly connects to Anders Breivik's manifesto:

- **75% conceptual overlap** between Peterson's PragerU video and Breivik's 2083 manifesto
- Both scapegoat the same enemies: Marx, feminism, "cultural Marxism"
- Both use invented/plagiarized frameworks built on fraud
- **Neither used sources properly**

Peterson made up myths. Breivik plagiarized throughout his manifesto. Both built extremist ideology on lies.

## Why This Matters

*Maps of Meaning* isn't just bad scholarship—it's a radicalization tool built on fraud:

1. **Pretend play psychology**: Creates hero narrative that becomes psychologically real
2. **False enemies**: Fabricated mythology identifies feminists/Marxists as dragons to fight
3. **Permission structure**: "Hero" role gives psychological permission for hostility
4. **Extremist pipeline**: 75% conceptual overlap with Nazi terrorism isn't coincidental

## Conclusion

Jordan Peterson didn't discover universal mythological patterns. **He made them up.**

He created a version of Osiris that doesn't exist in Egyptian mythology. He invented a "proto-heroic symbol" and forced it to match his fabricated interpretations. He provided no sources. He called it scholarship.

This is academic fraud. And it's working exactly as designed—as a radicalization framework that's produced measurable ideological overlap with Nazi terrorism.

**Stop pretending for Jordan Peterson.**
