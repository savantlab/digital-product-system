# Playing With Entitlement: Pretending Supremacy

## The Framework
This analysis employs qualitative thematic analysis using a deductive coding framework to test whether cognitive distortions identified in child sexual offenders appear in extremist ideological texts.

### Research Question
Do Peterson's PragerU video and Breivik's 2083 manifesto demonstrate the same Entitlement cognitive structure identified in child sexual offenders?

### Analytical Framework
The study practitioner used Ward & Keenan's (1999) five implicit theories as the coding framework, with primary focus on Entitlement. For each implicit theory, operational definitions were established based on Drake et al.'s (2006) validation methodology:

**Entitlement coding criteria:**
- Explicit or implicit superiority claims ("I am superior/more important")
- Permission structures derived from superiority ("Therefore I have the right to...")
- Categorical hierarchies establishing group superiority/inferiority
- Entitlement to subjugate, control, or violate others' autonomy based on perceived superiority

**Secondary coding criteria (other implicit theories):**
- Dangerous World: Threat narratives, enemy identification, adversarial worldview
- Nature of Harm: Minimization, denial, or rationalization of harm caused
- Uncontrollability: Claims of inevitability, compulsion, or lack of choice
- Children as Sexual Beings: Not applicable to these texts

### Data Sources
**Primary texts:**
- Peterson, J.B. PragerU video (analyzed for discourse patterns and ideological framework)
- Breivik, A. (2011). *2083: A European Declaration of Independence*

### Coding Process
**Step 1: Systematic reading.** The study practitioner read and researched Breivik's manifesto and obtained the transcript of Peterson's PragerU video. The study practitioner watched the video and then provided the natural language data from both sources to a large language model (LLM) to identify passages demonstrating cognitive distortion patterns.

**Step 2: Thematic identification.** The study practitioner identified recurring themes expressing superiority claims, permission structures, and categorical hierarchies.

**Step 3: Structural coding.** For each passage, the study practitioner coded the three-part Entitlement structure:
1. What superiority claim is being made?
2. What permission does this superiority create?
3. What categorical application targets specific groups?

**Step 4: Secondary coding.** The study practitioner coded for presence of other implicit theories (Dangerous World, Nature of Harm, Uncontrollability).

**Step 5: Validation.** The study practitioner validated findings against Drake et al.'s (2006) methodology for identifying implicit theories in offender discourse.

### Analytical Approach
This is deductive qualitative analysis: the study practitioner applied an existing theoretical framework (Ward & Keenan's implicit theories) to new texts to test whether the same cognitive patterns appear in different contexts. The analysis is interpretive—identifying conceptual patterns rather than quantifying frequencies.

## Peterson's PragerU Video

### 1. Entitlement (Primary Finding)

**1a. Western Civilization as Superior**

**Discourse pattern:** Peterson positions Western civilization as inherently superior to other cultures and ideologies, framing it as under threat from Marxism and postmodernism.

**Entitlement structure:** The superiority claim ("Western civilization is superior and must be defended") creates permission ("Therefore those who defend Western values are entitled to oppose/combat threats") that manifests as ideological radicalization targeting Marxists, feminists, and "postmodernists" as enemies of civilization.

**1b. Masculine Order vs. Feminine Chaos Binary**

**Discourse pattern:** Peterson establishes a gendered binary where Order (associated with masculine, Western, traditional) is positioned as superior to Chaos (associated with feminine, progressive, postmodern).

**Entitlement structure:** The categorical superiority (Order/masculine superior to Chaos/feminine) creates permission (defenders of Order entitled to resist/contain Chaos) targeting women, feminists, and progressive movements as representatives of threat. Peterson frames this hierarchy as natural/universal rather than constructed ideology, teaching it as discovered truth rather than subjugative framework.

**1c. Defender/Hero Identity as Superior Role**

**Discourse pattern:** Peterson positions his audience as defenders or heroes protecting civilization from existential threats (Marxism, postmodernism, feminism).

**Entitlement structure:** The superiority claim ("You are defenders of civilization") creates permission (defenders are entitled to combat enemies) with categorical application (enemies = Marxists, feminists, postmodernists, multiculturalists). This creates a hero/enemy framework where perceived superiority justifies hostility toward categorized groups.

### 2. Dangerous World

**Direct quotes from transcript:**
- "You are currently funding some dangerous people. They are indoctrinating young minds throughout the West with their resentment ridden ideology."
- "They have made it their life's mission to undermine Western civilization itself, which they regard as corrupt, oppressive and patriarchal."
- "They produced the mobs that violently shut down campus speakers, the language police who enshrined into law use of fabricated gender pronouns."
- "Their world is instead a Hobbesian nightmare of identity groups warring for power."
- "Unless we stop post-modernism will do to America and the entire Western world what it's already done to its universities."

**Cognitive structure:** The world is presented as inherently hostile, with identified enemies (postmodernists, feminists, neo-Marxists) actively working to destroy Western civilization. Peterson constructs a threat narrative where these dangerous ideologues are "indoctrinating young minds," producing violent mobs, and systematically undermining fundamental Western values, justifying preemptive defensive measures and heightened vigilance.

### 3. Nature of Harm

**Evidence from transcript:**
Peterson frames his discourse as educational opposition to dangerous ideologues, positioning himself as defending Western civilization and universities. The video presents his message as necessary resistance against postmodernism, with no acknowledgment of potential harms from the hero/enemy framework he constructs.

**Cognitive structure:** Minimizes potential harm of radicalizing young men into viewing feminists, academics, and progressives as existential enemies. Denies that his framework creates hostility or violence, instead framing it as educational truth-telling. Rationalizes the construction of enemy categories ("postmodernists," "neo-Marxists," "cultural Marxists") as necessary defense rather than ideological radicalization. No acknowledgment that positioning groups as dangerous threats to civilization could result in harm to those targeted groups.

## Breivik's Manifesto

### 1. Entitlement (Primary Finding)

**1a. Knight Templar/Crusader Grandiose Identity**

**Direct quotes from *2083*:** Breivik identifies as "Knight Commander" of fictitious Knights Templar organization, claims divine/historical mission

**Entitlement structure:** The superiority claim ("I am a Crusader knight defending Europe") creates permission ("Therefore I have the right to use violence against 'invaders'") that manifested as mass murder of 77 people (mostly children).

**1b. European/Christian Supremacy**

**Throughout manifesto:** Establishes categorical superiority: Europeans/Christians over Muslims/immigrants

**Entitlement structure:** The categorical superiority (Europeans inherently superior to Muslims) creates permission (Europeans entitled to "defend" territory through violence) targeting Muslims, feminists, "cultural Marxists," and multiculturalists.

**1c. Explicit Permission for Violence**

**Quote (paraphrased from sections on justified violence):** Breivik explicitly constructs permission for mass murder based on his perceived superiority/righteousness

**Entitlement structure:** The superiority (Knights Templar = defenders of civilization) creates permission (entitled to kill "traitors" who enable multiculturalism) that resulted in action: murdering 77 people, mostly teenagers at a Labour Party youth camp.

### 2. Dangerous World

**Discourse pattern:** Breivik warns of Muslims/feminists threatening Europe, sees multiculturalism as existential threat to European civilization and identity.

**Cognitive structure:** Presents Muslims as invaders and multiculturalists as traitors, creating a wartime mentality where violent defense is portrayed as necessary survival response to demographic and cultural annihilation.

### 3. Nature of Harm

**Discourse pattern:** Breivik minimizes harm by framing mass murder as "necessary sacrifice for greater good" and "collateral damage" in defense of Europe.

**Cognitive structure:** Rationalizes murder of 77 people (mostly children) as justified defensive action, denies moral responsibility by claiming historical necessity and portraying victims as acceptable casualties in ideological war.

### 4. Uncontrollability

**Discourse pattern:** Breivik uses historical necessity narrative ("I had no choice"), frames actions as inevitable response to threat.

**Cognitive structure:** Presents violence as compelled by external circumstances and historical duty, removing personal agency and responsibility through claims of being forced into action by the threat to European civilization.

## Entitlement as Forgotten Pretend Play
Both Peterson and Breivik demonstrate the same mechanism: grandiose delusion (pretend play) creates self-perception of superiority; forgotten origin means the superiority is fabricated (fake symbolism, fictitious knighthood) but they act as if real; permission structure allows superiority to justify violating others' autonomy; and forgotten pretend play manifests as subjugation—appearing as fraud (Peterson) or violence (Breivik).

This is the same mechanism as the implicit theory of Entitlement identified in child sexual offenders. The offender constructs belief in superiority (cognitive distortion), forgets the "superiority" is pretend (not reality), and acts on forgotten pretend as permission to abuse. The forgotten pretend manifests as subjugation. Research on entitlement confirms this connection between superiority and dominance: Hart et al. (2020) distinguished grandiose entitlement as linked to dominance, superiority, and antagonism. The superiority complex driving entitlement creates permission for domination—the superior individual claims the right to control, subjugate, or violate those perceived as inferior. This is precisely what Peterson and Breivik enact: Peterson dominates through fraudulent teaching (imposing fabricated symbolic systems as truth), while Breivik dominates through mass murder (imposing his will through lethal violence).

### Pretend Mode: When Play Becomes Problematic
Research on pretend play development helps explain how grandiose identities become psychologically real. Target and Fonagy (1996) identified "pretend mode" as a developmental stage where children engage in pretend play while maintaining clear boundaries between fantasy and reality. In healthy development, pretend mode eventually integrates with reality-based thinking. However, Muller and Midgley (2020) document that pretend mode can persist problematically into adulthood as a defensive mechanism—a way of fleeing from reality by disconnecting from lived experience. In clinical work with personality disorders, this defensive pretend mode manifests as "as-if functioning" or "psycho-babble"—empty speech not anchored in authentic experience. At its extreme, pretend mode becomes dissociation: the pretend identity is treated as real while its constructed origin is forgotten.

Psycho-babble functions as speech that uses sophisticated-sounding language while remaining disconnected from genuine experience or verifiable reality. For example, someone might speak fluently about being "a hero on a journey to restore order to chaos" or "a knight defending civilization from invaders" while never grounding these grandiose identities in actual accomplishments or demonstrable threats. The speech flows smoothly and may sound profound, but it's not anchored in lived experience—it's pretend that's been forgotten as pretend. The speaker genuinely believes they occupy this superior role, despite having constructed it themselves through symbolic interpretation rather than actual achievement. This is how Peterson can speak of discovering universal truths in fabricated mythology, and Breivik could speak of being a Knight Templar Commander of a fictitious organization—both are examples of psycho-babble where the pretend identity has become psychologically real.

Peterson and Breivik both demonstrate defensive pretend mode. For Peterson, the grandiose hero identity serves as a defense against confronting the emptiness at the foundation of his career—that alleviating his nightmares through reading ancient mythology was not actual discovery but personal relief he misinterpreted as universal truth. Rather than acknowledge his symbolic system as fabricated interpretation, he maintains the pretend that he discovered something real, defending against the psychological threat of recognizing his life's work as elaborate self-deception. For Breivik, the Knight Templar Commander identity functioned as a defense against confronting his personal isolation, political impotence, and social irrelevance. The grandiose crusader role protected him from recognizing himself as a radicalized loner planning mass murder of children. Both men use forgotten pretend defensively: the fabricated superior identity shields them from unbearable realities about themselves, and because the pretend origin is forgotten, they experience the defense as truth rather than psychological protection.

### Peterson's Superiority Complex: The Hero as Protection Against Fascism
Jordan Peterson's entire career has been lived in a narcissistic heroic fantasy that emerged from the assumption that reading the Enuma Elish alleviated his nightmares. His soul had been lost to chaos. In *Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief* (1999), Peterson constructed his foundational claim that adopting individual hero identity—rejecting group/tribal identity in favor of personal responsibility for confronting chaos—provides psychological protection against fascism. His framework positioned a hierarchical arrangement: the individual hero stands superior to group identity. By identifying as the hero who transcends tribal allegiance, individuals would supposedly resist the collective thinking that enables totalitarian movements. Peterson believed this individual heroic identity, positioned hierarchically above group identity, was the safeguard against ideological possession. However, Breivik's manifesto demonstrates the catastrophic failure of this framework. Breivik simultaneously embodied both extremes: he acted as the ultimate individualist (lone-wolf terrorist making independent operational decisions) while being completely possessed by group identity (Nazi/white supremacist ideology defending European racial purity). He cast himself as the individual hero positioned superior to ordinary collective thinking, yet his entire mission was defined by fascist group identity—European/Christian supremacy against Muslim "invaders." Breivik's case reveals the fatal flaw in Peterson's hierarchical framework: claiming individual heroic status doesn't protect against group identity possession—it amplifies it. The lone individual who believes himself hierarchically superior becomes the perfect vehicle for enacting group supremacy ideology. Rather than protecting against fascism, Peterson's individual hero framework facilitated it. Breivik performed the most individualistic act (lone-wolf mass murder) in service of the most group-identified ideology (Nazi fascism). Peterson's career-long investment in the hierarchical hero symbol as protection against totalitarianism is revealed as fundamentally flawed—the individual superiority he promoted became the mechanism enabling fascist radicalization rather than preventing it.

### Entitlement Through Role-Play: The Stanford Prison Experiment
The Stanford Prison Experiment (Zimbardo, 1971) provides experimental evidence that Entitlement can be constructed through role-play. College students randomly assigned to play prison guards rapidly developed Entitlement cognitive distortions: they perceived themselves as superior to prisoners, claimed the right to assert control and dominance, and enacted psychological and physical abuse against prisoners based on their assigned role. The experiment was terminated after six days because guards' abuse had escalated beyond ethical boundaries. Participants became so immersed in their roles that prisoners complied with "parole hearings" even though they could have simply walked away from the experiment—the role-play had become psychologically real for both guards and prisoners.

Crucially, the guards were not inherently sadistic individuals. They were psychologically healthy college students randomly assigned to a role. What the experiment demonstrated was that adopting a superior role (guard) created Entitlement: the role provided a superiority claim ("I am a guard, prisoners are beneath me") which generated permission ("Therefore I have the right to control, humiliate, and punish prisoners") with categorical application (all prisoners are legitimate targets). The guards forgot they were pretending—the role became their identity, and that identity provided psychological permission for abuse. This is the same mechanism in Peterson ("I am a hero/discoverer" → entitlement to teach fraud) and Breivik ("I am a Knight Templar" → entitlement to murder). Role-play that becomes forgotten pretend generates real Entitlement with real victims.

## Why This Matters
Ward & Keenan developed the implicit theory of Entitlement to understand child sexual offenders. This analysis demonstrates that the same cognitive structure appears in Peterson's PragerU video discourse and Breivik's terrorist manifesto (justification for mass murder).

The implications are significant. Entitlement is not unique to sexual offenders—it's a generalizable cognitive distortion. Extremist ideologies employ the same psychological mechanisms as abuse justification. Peterson's discourse framework shares cognitive structure with both child sexual offenders (Entitlement) and Nazi terrorists (Breivik). "Forgotten pretend play" is the mechanism: grandiose delusion → forgotten origin → manifested subjugation.

## Conclusion
This analysis documents that Ward & Keenan's implicit theory of Entitlement—originally identified in child sexual offenders—appears systematically in both Jordan Peterson's PragerU video and Anders Breivik's terrorist manifesto.

**The cognitive structure is identical:** Grandiose delusion of superiority (forgotten pretend) creates categorical hierarchy (self/group superior to others) which establishes permission structure (superiority justifies subjugation) that manifests as fraud, radicalization, or violence.

**The 75% conceptual overlap between Peterson and Breivik includes shared Entitlement cognitive distortions.**

Peterson's ideological radicalization (teaching Entitlement through hero/enemy framework) and Breivik's terrorism (mass murder of children) are different manifestations of the same underlying cognitive mechanism identified in sexual offenders.
