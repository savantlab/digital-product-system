## Flog Article: Maps of Meaning Fraud

**New Article Created**: `/flog/maps-of-meaning-fraud`

Comprehensive documentation of Peterson's academic fraud:
- Central fraud: Fabricated "proto-heroic symbol" across myths
- Created Osiris version not in Egyptian mythology, no sources
- "Mythological perspective" = myth-making = lying
- False Chaos/Order dichotomy for radicalization
- Pattern: Fabricate symbolism, claim universality, no sources, use for radicalization
- Connection to Breivik: 75% overlap, both built on fraud, neither used sources properly
- Pretend play psychology creates radicalization framework

Slides now link to this article for complete fraud documentation.

## Maps of Meaning Fraud Finding Added

### New Slide in Methodology Section

**Slide: "Research Finding - Fraud in Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief"**
- Documents central fraud discovery from Maps of Meaning analysis
- Peterson claims "proto-heroic symbol" exists across myths - the hero who explores the unknown
- Built framework on false Chaos/Order dichotomy
- "Hero" = hypothetical person (probably man) Peterson radicalizes symbolically in reader's psyche
- Claims meaning is "intrinsic to mythological perspective" but this really means myth-making = lying
- Tried to force invented hero to "make sense" with Osiris and Horus - created false myth
- Pattern: Fabricated Osiris/Horus connection, incorrect yin-yang, Chaos/Order false dichotomy
- Peterson pretends invented hero narrative is found in actual mythology
- He's making up myths and calling it scholarship - academic fraud at Harvard
- Links to The Flog for complete documentation of fabricated symbolism

## Stanford Prison Experiment Analysis Added

### New Slides in Implications Section

**Slide: "Pretend Play as Radicalization Tool - The Stanford Prison Experiment Lesson"**
- Explains Stanford Prison Experiment (1971) setup and results
- Shows how participants knew it was fake but roles became psychologically real
- Guards became sadistic, prisoners traumatized within days
- Terminated after 6 days due to cruelty
- Key lesson: Pretend play provides psychological permission for real cruelty
- Citation: Zimbardo, P.G. (1973). On the ethics of intervention in human psychological research: With special reference to the Stanford Prison Experiment. Cognition, 2(2), 245-256.

**Slide: "Peterson's Pretend Play Framework - Maps of Meaning as Radicalization Scaffold"**
- Direct parallel between Stanford experiment and Peterson's methodology
- Peterson's framework: hero fighting chaos/dragons (fabricated symbolism)
- Students adopt hero role, feminism becomes dragon, Marx becomes villain
- Like Stanford guards, students forget it's pretend—acts on imagined war
- Breivik as extreme example: violent action on Peterson's hero narrative
- **NEW: Adult pretend play research section added**
  - Citations: Kapitany, R., Hampejs, T., & Goldstein, T.R. (2022). Pretensive shared reality: From childhood pretense to adult imaginative play. Frontiers in Psychology, 13, 774085.
  - Shows adults regularly engage in "pretensive shared reality"—shared representations of bounded fictional realities that become psychologically real
  - Demonstrates pretend play is not limited to childhood
  - Explains Peterson weaponizes this mechanism through Maps of Meaning
- Emphasizes Peterson never admits symbolism is fabricated (Osiris, yin-yang)
- Conclusion: Radicalization through pretend play psychology

**Slide: "The Family Business - Peterson Academy and Potential RICO Violations"**
- Documents Peterson Academy as fraudulent family enterprise
- Unaccredited "university" charging $499/year, no legitimate degrees
- Founded by Peterson and daughter Mikhaila Fuller (CEO)
- Potential RICO violations: pattern of fraud (Harvard → Peterson Academy), family enterprise, mail/wire fraud
- Counter-terrorism framework: radicalization pipeline monetized as family business
- "Stop Pretending" thesis: This is fraud, not alternative education
- Links to The Flog for detailed fraud documentation

**Slide: "Shared Fraud Pattern - Peterson and Breivik: Both Built on Lies"**
- Documents parallel fraud between Peterson and Breivik
- Peterson: Created Osiris not in Egyptian mythology, no sources, fabricated proto-heroic symbol, academic fraud
- Breivik: Copy-paste plagiarism throughout manifesto, didn't use sources properly, stole material
- Pattern: Both built extremist ideology on fraud and lies
- 75% conceptual overlap between two fraudulent works
- Not "misinterpretation" - deliberate frauds promoting Nazi-adjacent ideology

**Slide: "Looking for Someone to Blame - Peterson and Breivik: Same Blaming Pattern"**
- Documents both wrote looking for someone to blame
- Breivik's manifesto: 1,518 pages blaming Marx, feminists, multiculturalism, cultural Marxism
- Peterson's PragerU: 726 words blaming Marx, feminists, postmodernism, identity politics  
- Same targets, same way, same reasons - 75% conceptual overlap
- Pattern: Both looking for opportunity to blame
- Not coincidence - shared extremist ideology
- "When you blame the same people the same way a Nazi terrorist does, that's not misinterpretation"

**Slide: "Defining Radicalization - Pretend Play as Mass Media Strategy"**
- Establishes definition: Producing mass media predicated on writer's pretend play (ego) fighting imagined war to recruit others
- Peterson's Culture War: Ego as hero fighting chaos/Marxism, mass media (PragerU/Maps of Meaning), recruitment to fight "dragons"
- Breivik's War Movement: Ego as crusader, imagined war (Europe vs Islam/Marxism), 1,518 page manifesto, tried to initiate armed resistance
- Pattern: Both use pretend play psychology to recruit into imagined wars
- Writer's ego creates hero narrative → mass media distributes → followers adopt role → war becomes psychologically real

### Course Statistics
- Methodology section: Now 17 slides (was 16)
- Implications section: Now 28 slides (was 22)
- Total course: Now 99 slides (was 92)

### Key Analytical Framework
The Stanford Prison Experiment demonstrates how pretend play frameworks become psychologically real and dangerous. Peterson's Maps of Meaning operates the same way—creating imagined wars through fabricated symbolism, then people act on it as if it's real. This is the mechanism of radicalization through pretend play.
