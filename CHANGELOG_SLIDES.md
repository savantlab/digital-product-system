## Maps of Meaning Fraud Finding Added

### New Slide in Methodology Section

**Slide: "Research Finding - Fraud in Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief"**
- Documents central fraud discovery from Maps of Meaning analysis
- Peterson claimed to have symbol depicting "the hero who explores the unknown"
- Reality: No such symbol exists in heraldic tradition - Peterson fabricated/pretended it existed

- Pattern of fraud: Osiris (fabricated), yin-yang (incorrectly derived), hero symbol (invented)
- Identifies this as academic fraud at Harvard

## Stanford Prison Experiment Analysis Added

### New Slides in Implications Section

**Slide: "Pretend Play as Radicalization Tool - The Stanford Prison Experiment Lesson"**
- Explains Stanford Prison Experiment (1971) setup and results
- Shows how participants knew it was fake but roles became psychologically real
- Guards became sadistic, prisoners traumatized within days
- Terminated after 6 days due to cruelty
- Key lesson: Pretend play provides psychological permission for real cruelty
- Citation: Zimbardo, P.G. (1973). On the ethics of intervention in human psychological research: With special reference to the Stanford Prison Experiment. Cognition, 2(2), 245-256.

**Slide: "Peterson's Pretend Play Framework - Maps of Meaning as Radicalization Scaffold"**
- Direct parallel between Stanford experiment and Peterson's methodology
- Peterson's framework: hero fighting chaos/dragons (fabricated symbolism)
- Students adopt hero role, feminism becomes dragon, Marx becomes villain
- Like Stanford guards, students forget it's pretend—acts on imagined war
- Breivik as extreme example: violent action on Peterson's hero narrative
- **NEW: Adult pretend play research section added**
  - Citations: Kapitany, R., Hampejs, T., & Goldstein, T.R. (2022). Pretensive shared reality: From childhood pretense to adult imaginative play. Frontiers in Psychology, 13, 774085.
  - Shows adults regularly engage in "pretensive shared reality"—shared representations of bounded fictional realities that become psychologically real
  - Demonstrates pretend play is not limited to childhood
  - Explains Peterson weaponizes this mechanism through Maps of Meaning
- Emphasizes Peterson never admits symbolism is fabricated (Osiris, yin-yang)
- Conclusion: Radicalization through pretend play psychology

**Slide: "The Family Business - Peterson Academy and Potential RICO Violations"**
- Documents Peterson Academy as fraudulent family enterprise
- Unaccredited "university" charging $499/year, no legitimate degrees
- Founded by Peterson and daughter Mikhaila Fuller (CEO)
- Potential RICO violations: pattern of fraud (Harvard → Peterson Academy), family enterprise, mail/wire fraud
- Counter-terrorism framework: radicalization pipeline monetized as family business
- "Stop Pretending" thesis: This is fraud, not alternative education
- Links to The Flog for detailed fraud documentation

### Course Statistics
- Methodology section: Now 17 slides (was 16)
- Implications section: Now 25 slides (was 22)
- Total course: Now 96 slides (was 92)

### Key Analytical Framework
The Stanford Prison Experiment demonstrates how pretend play frameworks become psychologically real and dangerous. Peterson's Maps of Meaning operates the same way—creating imagined wars through fabricated symbolism, then people act on it as if it's real. This is the mechanism of radicalization through pretend play.
